#list files in "folder" with range of times in this case all files taken from 1:40pm till 1:50pm on 2023 10 24 this is about 1200 images

ls folder/*20231024_134*
or
find folder -type f -name "*20231024_134*"

6 make directory to copy a subset of files
mkdir subset

7 copy files in range to subset directory

#this finds all files in folder "set" that include "*20231024_134*" and copies to folder "subset"

find set -type f -name "*20231024_134*" -exec cp {} subset \;
find chaindigger -type f -name "*20240904_134*" -exec cp {} selec2 \;

zip -r chain_images.zip subset
unzip chain_images.zip

9 use FileZilla to copy subset folder from rpi to laptop
or
scp -P <SERVER_PORT> <PATH_TO_LOCAL_FILE> <SERVER_USER@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>:<PATH_TO_DESTINATION_FOLDER>
scp -P <SERVER_PORT> <SERVER_USER@SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>:<PATH_TO_REMOTE_FILE> <PATH_TO_LOCAL_DESTINATION_FOLDER>

from laptop terminal use scp to copy remote folder "subset" in mnt on remote pi
scp ubuntu@10.10.0.30:/mnt/data/chain_images2.zip ~/

10 remove any temporary folders
